To complete the labs, I will make an individual GitHub repo for each student. You'll clone the repo into your Posit Cloud RStudio workspace, complete the assignment, and push your work back to GitHub. 

Solutions will be posted in each lab repo on the [ENST222-SP2023 GitHub organization page](https://github.com/ENST222-2023SP)

## lab-01 {-}
**Hello R!:** This lab exercise is designed to get you set up with the computational tools we will be using throughout the semester. Use the instructions linked below to get started. They will walk you through everything else you need to do. Note that you will submit your work by knitting your final RMarkdown document, committing your changes using Git, and pushing your changes to your GitHub lab-01 repository. Don't worry if this sounds very foreign - you will learn all about it in lab.

**Global plastic waste:** In this lab, you'll practice visualizing numeric and categorical data using the `ggplot2` package. To get started, go to the course GitHub organization and locate your assignment repo, which should be named `lab-02-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`. Copy the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio. Refer to
[Lab 01](https://enst222.github.io/lab-instructions/lab-01/lab-01-hello-r.html) for step-by-step instructions on cloning a repo into an RStudio project. Open the R Markdown document `lab-02.Rmd` and follow the instructions in the doc. There is not a separate instructions file for this lab. Questions and instructions are included in the template file provided.

## lab-03 {-}
**Global deforestation:** In this lab, we continue to ask questions and answer them by visualizing data. We also begin to practice data wrangling and tidying. Questions and instructions are included in the template file provided. To get started, go to the course GitHub organization and locate your assignment repo, which should be named `lab-03-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`. Copy the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio. Refer to
[Lab 01](https://enst222.github.io/lab-instructions/lab-01/lab-01-hello-r.html) for step-by-step instructions on cloning a repo into an RStudio project.
