<h2>Course description<a href="syllabus.html#course-description" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A rapidly increasing number of applications in industry, academia, and everyday life are – or should be – based on careful analysis of data. With technological advances that make environmental measurement cheaper and easier, and open science tools that make data more accessible, the environmental field could be described as “drowning in data.” In this course, students will learn how to use tools from statistics and computer science to gain insight from environmental data without “drowning” in it. Throughout the course, we will use literate programming and version control tools so that our analyses are reproducible and accessible. We will also explore the ethics of data science to learn how to use these new skills fairly and responsibly. We will do all of this using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, one of the most popular and in-demand statistical programming languages in environmental and ecological fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Learning outcomes<a href="syllabus.html#learning-outcomes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>At the completion of this course, students will be able to gain insight from environmental data <strong>reproducibly</strong> (with literate programming and version control) and <strong>collaboratively</strong> using <strong>modern programming tools and techniques</strong>.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes include being able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>visualize data using <code>ggplot2</code></li>
<li>wrangle and tidy data tables using the <code>dplyr</code> package to generate a suitable data set for analysis</li>
<li>conduct exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses</li>
<li>construct statistical models to quantify patterns and make predictions</li>
<li>communicate results and document code using RMarkdown documents</li>
<li>store data and code using a clean and clear system of organization</li>
<li>use version control tools (Git and GitHub) to collaborate and share code</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Grading<a href="syllabus.html#grading" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This is an “ungraded” course. I want you to focus on learning R and developing your quantitative reasoning skills without the stress of losing points over minor mistakes. Mistakes are inevitable in this type of course. In fact, making mistakes and fixing them is the best way to learn! Furthermore, <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/">research has shown</a> that grading doesn’t improve learning and can sometimes even harm learning. Rather than submitting work to me “in exchange” for a letter or number grade, you will self-evaluate your weekly assignments by comparing them to the provided solutions documents, and your peers and I will provide qualitative feedback on your projects. This should help you think intentionally about what you’re learning, what you’re struggling with, and what you need to do to maximize your learning in the course. Hopefully, this will spark your inner motivation to do your best work. Brief learning reflections will be an important component of most assignments. Periodically throughout the semester, you will also submit more substantial learning reflections in which you give yourself a grade based on your progress in the course (since we still need to submit grades to the registrar at the end of the semester). As the instructor, I have the final say in your grade. But I rarely find that changing a student’s self-assessed grade is necessary - I trust your judgment.</p>
<p>We have all been “raised” in a system where most of our learning efforts have revolved around grades, so I know it may be challenging to deviate from that system. I hope that this experience, which puts you in charge of your own learning process and assessment, will be liberating.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Course materials<a href="syllabus.html#course-materials" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>All of the readings and software in this class are <strong>free</strong>. There are free online version of all the textbooks, and R, RStudio, and GitHub are also free. Two resources which we’ll use frequently are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R 4 Data Science</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/">Introduction to Modern Statistics</a></li>

<div id="assignments" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Assignments<a href="syllabus.html#assignments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<div id="homework" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Homework<a href="syllabus.html#homework" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Beyond the in-class activities, you will be assigned additional programming tasks each week. These assignments are designed to help you practice, apply, and extend the concepts we cover in class. You can certainly discuss the assignments with your peers, but they should be completed individually to demonstrate your own individual learning. Homeworks will be submitted as GitHub repositories.</p>
</div>
<div id="lab-exercises" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Lab exercises<a href="syllabus.html#lab-exercises" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>These will be held on Monday afternoons. I expect that you show up to the lab sessions weekly. During these sessions you will work in teams on computing exercises. You will usually have enough time to complete the exercises during the designated lab time, but they don’t need to be turned in until the following Monday before the next lab. That way, you have additional time to continue working, collaborate further, clean things up, revise, etc. if needed. Labs will be submitted as GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>A frequently asked question is “What happens if I can’t make it to a lab one week because I’m sick or have another obligation at that time?”</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re missing a lab day due to short-term illness or some other reason, you should communicate this with your team and work with them to come up with a plan for how you will contribute to the assignment before the deadline. If the lab is a team assignment and you have made 0 commits towards a lab assignment, you will not have learned from that assignment or contributed to your learning community. You need to participate in order to be a team player and also for your own individual learning.</li>
<li>If you’re unable to contribute to a team lab assignment because of an illness taking you away from school work for an extended period of time, you should let your team know that you won’t be able to contribute to that lab and also talk to me so we can come up with an alternative plan for you to learn that content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class once or twice.</p>
</div>
<div id="group-projects" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Group projects<a href="syllabus.html#group-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>You will be also responsible for completing two open ended group projects for this course, the goal of which is to tackle an “interesting” problem using the tools and techniques covered in this class. Additional details on the projects will be provided as the course progresses. Each team’s work will also be shared with and evaluated by at least one other team at various stages in order to provide feedback in the form of code review. You must complete the final projects and be in class to present them in order to pass this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="peer-feedback" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Peer feedback<a href="syllabus.html#peer-feedback" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>My goal is to help facilitate an engaged learning community so that you have a lot of support as you work through challenging concepts. An important aspect of our learning community will be providing peer feedback on homework assignments and projects. Not only will you provide useful insights for your peers, but you will also learn from other students by closely examining their code.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-reflections" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Learning reflections<a href="syllabus.html#learning-reflections" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Because this is an ungraded class, our emphasis will be on qualitative reflection. Most if not all of of your assignments will include a reflection component in which you think about what you learned through the assignment, what challenges you faced, etc. You will also write three more in-depth reflections during the semester to more broadly evaluate your progress in the course. It is very important that you put earnest effort into all of the reflections to show that you are thinking carefully about your learning in the absence of quantitative grades.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="more-information-and-policies" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>More information and policies<a href="syllabus.html#more-information-and-policies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<div id="student-hours" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Student hours<a href="syllabus.html#student-hours" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Student hours (aka “office hours”) are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="sharing-reusing-code-and-academic-honesty" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Sharing / reusing code and academic honesty<a href="syllabus.html#sharing-reusing-code-and-academic-honesty" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments, you can help each other but you should not directly share code with another student in this class. Likewise, on team assignments you should not directly share code with another team in the class. The assignments are designed to help you learn - if you copy each other’s code, you’re missing important learning opportunities!</p>
<p>Students should be familiar with the official SMCM academic policies as outlined in the Course Catalog. You may also read the Student Handbook <a href="http://www.smcm.edu/tothepoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/08/student-handbook.pdf">To the Point</a> to acquaint yourself with this important set of college guidelines and regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="community-health" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Community health<a href="syllabus.html#community-health" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask. I want you to learn a lot of things from this class, but your health and the well-being of our learning community is more important. If you’re sick, please stay home. But do let me know via email when you will need to miss class. No documentation needed.</p>

<div id="smcm-resources" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>SMCM resources<a href="syllabus.html#smcm-resources" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Accomodations and Accessibility</strong>: SMCM is committed to providing access to the educational experience to students with disabilities and health conditions that impact learning. If you have received a letter from the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS), which outlines the academic accommodations to which you are entitled and those accommodations apply to this course, you MUST meet with me to review that letter. If you suspect that you have a learning need that could benefit from academic accommodations, you should contact the Office of Accessibility Services, who can help you learn more about how to proceed in this instance as well</p>
<p><strong>The Wellness Center</strong>: If you find yourself struggling with your mental or physical health this semester, please let me know. I am one of many people here at SMCM who care about you and your welfare. The Wellness Center (240-895-4289) provides numerous confidential health and counseling services including a 24/7 Counseling Helpline and same day/next day connections to counseling by calling 240-895-4289 or emailing the Director at <a href="mailto:lkscherer@smcm.edu" class="email">lkscherer@smcm.edu</a>.  To learn more about Wellness Center Services please go to their webpage at www.smcm.edu/Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>Office of Student Support Services</strong>: The Office of Student Support Services (OS3) connects students to the resources, activities, services, and programs that can help students be successful, thrive, and persist to graduation. They offer student success videos, one-on-one coaching (both academic and outside-the-class support), advising, transition programs, access to tutoring, etc. and work with students holistically. OS3 staff will reach out to students when faculty members are concerned about a student’s welfare (due to absences, poor performance, etc.) to offer assistance. OS3 can notify professors if a student will be absent due to a family or medical emergency. Students needing help with Academic Policy petitions, Academic Probation, incompletes for a semester, etc. can work with a staff member in OS3. Students who are homeless or who do not have a safe place to go during a College break can receive funds to help pay for food when the Great Room is closed. Contact OS3 at 240-895-4388 to schedule an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>The Writing and Speaking Center</strong>: Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing &amp; Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other. To make an appointment, please visit www.smcm.edu/writingcenter and click the “Schedule an Appointment” button. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Assistant Director Mandy Taylor at <a href="mailto:apheatwole@smcm.edu" class="email">apheatwole@smcm.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Office of Title IX Compliance and Training</strong>: The College prohibits sexual or gender-based harassment, discrimination or misconduct, which includes sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, and stalking. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual harassment, you may contact the Title IX Office (www.smcm.edu/title-ix) or Title IX Coordinator Michael Dunn (<a href="mailto:mkdunn@smcm.edu" class="email">mkdunn@smcm.edu</a>) for more information about resources and options. Faculty members are required to share reports of sexual misconduct with the Title IX Office to make sure the College responds appropriately to address the health and safety needs of our community. Confidential support is also available through the Wellness Center (<a href="https://www.smcm.edu/wellness/" class="uri">https://www.smcm.edu/wellness/</a>).</p>
